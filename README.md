# project-memoria-advisories

This repository contains a list of security advisories issued by device vendors in response to vulnerabilities discovered in [Project Memoria](https://www.forescout.com/research-labs/project-memoria/).

While Forescout Research Labs works to keep this list updated (pull requests from all parties are welcome also), it may not be complete. Several vendors are still investigating whether they are affected by these vulnerabilities and there may be other issued advisories that we are not aware of.
